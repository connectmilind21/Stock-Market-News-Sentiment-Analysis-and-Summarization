# 📈 Stock Market News Sentiment Analysis and Summarization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI techniques to analyze stock market-related news articles. The goal is to extract sentiment signals and generate weekly summaries that can support stock price predictions and investment decisions. By understanding public sentiment and distilling key financial news, investors can make more informed and timely decisions.

## 📚 Course
Introduction to Natural Language Processing

## 🧠 Skills & Tools Covered
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Transformer Architectures (e.g., BERT, T5)
- Prompt Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Text Preprocessing
- Data Manipulation (Pandas, Numpy)
- Word Embeddings (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT embeddings)

## 🧪 Problem Statement
Can we automatically extract and summarize financial sentiment from news articles to enhance stock market prediction and improve trading strategies?

## 🛠️ Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Scraped or gathered financial news from various sources.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaned and normalized raw text (removing noise, tokenization, stop words, etc.).
3. **EDA**: Explored sentiment distributions, news frequency, and article metadata.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Applied transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for financial sentiment classification.
   - Fine-tuned with labeled datasets for domain-specific performance.
5. **Summarization**:
   - Generated concise weekly news summaries using models like T5 or GPT-based summarizers.
6. **Evaluation**:
   - Used metrics like accuracy, F1-score for classification; ROUGE/BLEU for summarization.
7. **Visualization**:
   - Displayed weekly sentiment trends and key news summaries.

## 📊 Key Outcomes
- Identified dominant weekly sentiment trends correlating with market movements.
- Automated summarization enabled quick understanding of financial news overload.
- Demonstrated the value of LLMs in financial sentiment extraction.

## 📈 Sample Results
- Positive sentiment peaks aligned with stock market rallies.
- Summarized news reduced reading load by 80% while retaining key insights.

## 📚 My Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience with transformer models and word embeddings.
- Learned how to structure unstructured text data for modeling.
- Understood the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning in NLP.
- Practiced prompt engineering for summarization and interpretation tasks.
